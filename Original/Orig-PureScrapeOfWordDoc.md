Exhibit A
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

These Terms and Conditions (“Terms and Conditions”) are attached to and incorporated into a Non-Disclosure Agreement (“NDA”). All Section number references in these Terms and Conditions shall be references to provisions in these Terms and Conditions unless explicitly stated otherwise.
Background
Disclosing Party or Disclosing Parties identified in the NDA own rights in such Party’s Confidential Information.  Each Disclosing Party considers it desirable to make Party’s Confidential Information available to Receiving Party or Parties for pursuing the Purpose identified in the NDA, subject to the terms and conditions hereof. 
1.	Definitions.
“Agreement” means collectively (i) these Terms and Conditions, and (ii) the NDA.
“Agreement Term” means the period identified as such in Block 3 of the NDA.
 “Confidential Information” means any non-public information of a Disclosing Party described in Block 4 of the NDA which is marked in accordance with Section 2 of this Exhibit and maintained as confi¬dential, including as examples, computer source codes, diagrams, electronic files, invention disclosures, patent applications, technical and scientific information, research data, draft publications, technical reports, research plans, business plans, financial reports, projections, and so forth, but excluding however any information which Receiving Party can establish by competent written proof (a) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge through no fault of Receiving Party; (b) was in the Receiving Party’s possession before receipt from the Disclosing Party; (c) was independently developed by Receiving Party without use of the Confidential Information; or (d) is received by Receiving Party, without restriction as to further disclosure,  from a third party having an apparent bona fide right to disclose the information to Receiving Party. 
“Confidentiality Term” means the period identified as such in Block 3 of the NDA.
“Contact Person” means the person designated by a Party as responsible for that Party’s receipt and/or delivery of Confidential Information as indicated in Block 2 of the NDA.
“Disclosing Party” means each Party that is identified as such in Block 4 of the NDA. 
 “Effective Date” means the date identified as such in Block 3 of the NDA.

2. Confidential Relationship 

Each Receiving Party will make all reasonable efforts to ensure the protection, confidentiality, and security of any Confidential Information of Disclosing Party in its possession, such efforts to be no less than the degree of care employed by Receiving Party to preserve and safeguard its own confidential information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care. Confidential Information will be transmitted in writing and clearly marked “Confidential,” “Proprietary,” or similarly, or if disclosed orally will be reduced to writing by Disclosing Party, clearly marked “Confidential,” “Proprietary,” or similarly, and transmitted to the Contact Person of Receiving Party within thirty (30) days after oral disclosure. 

3. Non-Disclosure 

Receiving Party will not disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, except as is expressly authorized by the Agreement.  Each Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information of Disclosing Party to its own employees assisting in making an evaluation of the Confidential Information; provided, however, that such employees are advised of the confidentiality and non-use obligations hereunder and are legally obligated by written agreement or otherwise to maintain the confidentiality and non-use of the Confidential Information.  In no event will a Receiving Party disclose Confidential Information to third parties unless it obtains the prior written consent of Disclosing Party; provided, that prior to any such disclosure, Receiving Party shall first obtain a written non-disclosure agreement from such third party containing terms and conditions substantially similar to those set forth herein. If requested, a copy of such executed agreement will be provided to Disclosing Party.  In addition, if there are three or more parties to the Agreement, then Confidential Information may be shared among multiple Receiving Parties, unless Disclosing Party provides a written notice restricting such sharing of information. 

If a Receiving Party is legally required by court order, law, or other governmental regulation or authority to disclose certain Confidential Information received from a Disclosing Party, such disclosure may be made only after giving written notice to Disclosing Party of such legal requirement so that Disclosing Party may object to such disclosure and seek a protective order; and in any event, the disclosure shall be limited to only that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required to be disclosed.

4. Non-Use 

Receiving Party will not use any Confidential Information of Disclosing Party for any reason other than the Purpose without the prior written consent of Disclosing Party. 

5. Copies 

Each Receiving Party agrees not to copy or record any Confidential Information of a Disclosing Party except as reasonably necessary to further the Purpose. Within thirty (30) days after the written request from Disclosing Party, each Receiving Party’s designated Contact Person will deliver all copies or records of Confidential Information in its possession or control to the appropriate Disclosing Party’s Contact Person, or will certify in writing to Disclosing Party that the Confidential Information of such Disclosing Party has been destroyed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Receiving Party may retain one archival copy of the Confidential Information received from Disclosing Party in a secure location to be used solely to determine its obligations under the Agreement.





6. Continuing Obligations 

Each Receiving Party’s obligations under the Agreement will survive termination of the Agreement and will continue until the end of the Confidentiality Term. 

7. No License or Warranty 

No license under or title to any invention, patent, trademark, trade name or other intellectual property or other rights or interests in the Confidential Information now or hereafter owned by or controlled by any Party is granted either expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise by the Agreement. No Party will use the name of another Party without prior written consent from such other Party.  All Confidential Information is provided “AS IS” and without warranty, express or implied, of any kind. 

8. Term 

Disclosures of Confidential Information pursuant to the Agreement are to be made only during the Agreement Term as defined in Block 3 of the NDA; provided, however, the obligations of the Agreement will survive until the end of the Confidentiality Term.

9. Injunction 
	
The Parties agree that, in the event of breach or threatened breach or intended breach of the Agreement, each Party, in addition to any other rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity, may seek injunctive or equitable relief without the necessity of posting bond or proving that it has no adequate remedy at law. 
	
10. Compliance with Laws; U.S. Export Compliance 

The Parties acknowledge that, because University is an institution of higher education and has many foreign persons who are students, employees and visitors, University conducts its research activities as “fundamental research” under export control regulations (as set forth in ITAR 120.10(5) and 120.11, and EAR 15 C.F.R. 734(b)(3) and 734.7 through 734.11).  Each Party acknowledges that this Agreement and the performance thereof are subject to compliance with any and all applicable United States laws, regulations, or orders, including those that may relate to the export of technical data, and each Party agrees to comply with all such laws, regulations and orders, including, if applicable, all requirements of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and/or the Export Administration Act, as may be amended.  Each Party further agrees that if the export laws are applicable, it will not disclose or re-export any technical data under this Agreement to any countries for which the United States government requires an export license or other supporting documentation at the time of export or transfer, unless the Disclosing Party has obtained prior written authorization from the U.S. Office of Export Control or other authority responsible for such matters.

11. Contacts 

Notices under the Agreement will be given to a Party’s person set forth in Block 1 of the NDA either by prepaid, first class, certified mail, return receipt requested or by internationally recognized overnight courier to the addresses set forth in Block 1 of the NDA or other addresses as may be given from time to time under the terms of this Section 11. Notice will be deemed given once the written notice is delivered at the designated address. Delivery via e-mail will not constitute notice. 

Confidential Information shall be delivered to the Contact Person for such Receiving Party indicated in Block 2 of the NDA or other persons specified from time to time by Receiving Party as its Contact Person by notice given in accordance with this Section 11.


12. Other Provisions 

The Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to choice of law principles. No amendment to the Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by the Parties. Neither the Agreement nor the rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder may be sold, assigned or otherwise transferred. If any provision of the Agreement is held to be unenforceable, all other provisions will continue in full force and effect. The Agreement supersedes any and all prior understandings or previous agreements between the Parties, oral or written, relating to the subject matter herein and constitutes the sole and complete agreement between the Parties related to the subject matter hereof.  Any delay by a Party to enforce any right under the Agreement shall not act as a waiver of that right, nor as a waiver of the Party’s ability to later assert that right relative to any particular factual situation. The Parties acknowledge that nothing in the Agreement shall constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity by Parties that are state agencies.
